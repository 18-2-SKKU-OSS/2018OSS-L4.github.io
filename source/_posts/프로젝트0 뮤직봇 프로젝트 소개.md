# MusicBot

---
### About this branch
This branch of MusicBot is only compatible with the rewrite version of the discord.py library. It is also a dependency in requirements.txt, so should be automatically installed by the bot if you run update.py.

### GitHub release v1.9.8_2 Python 3.5, 3.6 Discord
MusicBot is the original Discord music bot written for Python 3.5+, using the discord.py library. It plays requested songs, from YouTube and other services, into a Discord server (or multiple servers) and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs, if configured to do so. The bot features a permissions system allowing owners to restrict commands to certain people. As well as playing songs, MusicBot is capable of streaming live media into a voice channel (experimental).

# Setup
---
Setting up the MusicBot is relatively painless - just follow one of the [guides](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/) we have created for you. After that, you can begin to configure your bot to ensure that it can connect to Discord.

The main configuration file is config/options.ini, but is not included. Simply make a copy of example_options.ini and rename to options.ini. See example_options.ini for more information on how to configure it.

### Commands
There are many commands that can be used with the bot. Most notably, the play <url> command (preceded by your command prefix) will download, process, and play a song from YouTube or a similar site. A full list of commands are available [here](https://just-some-bots.github.io/MusicBot/using/commands/).
